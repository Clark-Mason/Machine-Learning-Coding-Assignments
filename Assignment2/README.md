1. Candidate Evaluation
What We Want to Do
For each candidate (an attribute–value pair), the intended question is:

"Is feature i equal to value v?"

This is a binary test that splits the data into two groups:

True branch: All examples where the feature equals the candidate value.
False branch: All other examples.
When evaluating how “good” this candidate is, we need to compute its information gain. Information gain is defined as:

IG
=
𝐻
(
𝑦
)
−
[
𝑝
(
True
)
 
𝐻
(
𝑦
∣
True
)
+
𝑝
(
False
)
 
𝐻
(
𝑦
∣
False
)
]
IG=H(y)−[p(True)H(y∣True)+p(False)H(y∣False)]
To do this correctly, we need a binary feature vector. That is, for each example, we convert the attribute into:

True if 
𝑥
[
𝑖
]
=
=
𝑣
x[i]==v
False otherwise.
What Went Wrong in the Incorrect Version
In the first implementation, the code computed the mutual information as follows:

python
Copy
for pair in attribute_value_pairs:
    info_gain = mutual_information(x[:, pair[0]], y)
Here, the entire column x[:, pair[0]] is used directly—without converting it into a binary feature. This is problematic because:

Multiple Unique Values:
The attribute might have more than two unique values. So instead of evaluating the split as “is it equal to v?”, it considers the distribution over all its values. This means the computed mutual information doesn’t reflect the binary question we intend.

Inconsistent Comparisons:
Every candidate is supposed to measure the gain of a binary split. By using the full attribute column, the calculation might inadvertently combine effects from multiple splits (one for each unique value) instead of isolating the effect of a single candidate value.

Correct Approach
The second implementation fixes this by converting the candidate to a binary feature:

python
Copy
for pair in attribute_value_pairs:
    binary_feature = (x[:, pair[0]] == pair[1])
    info_gain = mutual_information(binary_feature, y)
This way, the mutual information is computed for a column that only takes on two values (True and False), which exactly represents the question “is feature i equal to v?”

2. Data Partitioning
What We Want to Do
After selecting the best candidate (say, (i, v)), we need to split the data into two subsets:

Subset 1 (True branch): 
𝑥
[
𝑖
]
=
=
𝑣
x[i]==v
Subset 2 (False branch): 
𝑥
[
𝑖
]
≠
𝑣
x[i]

=v
This split must be unambiguous and yield exactly two branches for the binary tree.

What Went Wrong in the Incorrect Version
The incorrect implementation does the following:

python
Copy
partitions = partition(x[:, best_pair[0]])
for value, indices in partitions.items():
    # ... use value == best_pair[1] to decide branch ...
    tree[(best_pair[0], best_pair[1], value == best_pair[1])] = ...
Problems with this approach:

Iterating Over All Unique Values:
The code loops over every unique value in the attribute column.

If the attribute has more than two unique values, many of those values will be not equal to best_pair[1].
The expression value == best_pair[1] evaluates to False for all those, leading to multiple iterations for the False branch.
Ambiguous Branch Keys:
Because multiple unique values will yield False, you may inadvertently create duplicate keys in the tree or overwrite branches. Essentially, you’re not clearly separating the data into a unique True branch and a unique False branch.

Correct Approach
The correct method explicitly creates a binary test and partitions the data into two clear subsets:

python
Copy
binary_test = (x[:, best_pair[0]] == best_pair[1])

# True branch: where the condition holds
x_true = x[binary_test]
y_true = y[binary_test]
tree[(best_pair[0], best_pair[1], True)] = id3(x_true, y_true, remaining_pairs, depth + 1, max_depth)

# False branch: where the condition does not hold
x_false = x[~binary_test]
y_false = y[~binary_test]
tree[(best_pair[0], best_pair[1], False)] = id3(x_false, y_false, remaining_pairs, depth + 1, max_depth)
This approach:

Ensures Exactly Two Branches:
One branch for True (where the condition holds) and one for False (where it doesn’t).

Avoids Duplication:
There’s no looping over all unique values, so there’s no risk of merging or duplicating branches.

Summary of Why These Differences Matter
Mutual Information Computation:
If you compute mutual information over the full attribute column (with many unique values) instead of a binary column, the measure doesn’t represent the effectiveness of the binary split. The information gain might be inflated or deflated incorrectly, leading to poor candidate selection.

Data Partitioning:
Partitioning by iterating over all unique values and using value == best_pair[1] can cause:

Multiple iterations for the False branch: Every unique value that isn’t equal to the candidate value produces a False key.
Overwriting or ambiguous branches: Since all those different values lead to the same branch key (False), you might merge different subsets incorrectly.
By ensuring that candidate evaluation uses a binary feature and that data partitioning explicitly splits into two subsets, you obtain a decision tree that correctly models the binary question “is feature i equal to v?” and thus computes meaningful information gains and correct splits at every node.
